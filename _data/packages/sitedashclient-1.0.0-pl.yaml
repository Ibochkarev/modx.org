That information is sent to SiteDash, which\ntries to make sense out of it, and present it back to you in a convenient dashboard.\n\n\n\n## Installation\n\nDuring installation you'll be asked to provide a Site Key. Visit the SiteDash website,\nsignup or login, and create a site to generate a unique Site Key.\n\nOnce generate, paste the Site Key into the setup options field, which will then handle\nexchanging keys that are used to cryptographically sign further communication.\n\nIt is strongly recommended to set up your site to use HTTPS. This will ensure that\ncommunication between SiteDash and your website is encrypted. On HTTP we check the\nauthenticity, but the returned information may be readable by attackers in the middle.\n\n\n\n## What information is collected?\n\nThe Client sends back a lot of information, allowing SiteDash to provide you with good\ninsights you may not have seen otherwise.\n\nThe collected information includes:\n\n- MODX Version number\n- MODX Manager URL, language, and the selected rich text editor\n- Indication if the core folder is moved out of the root\n- PHP Version number\n- PDO Driver name, client version, and server version.\n- Total amount of disk space available, and free disk space avaialble\n- Configured memory limit and max execution time\n- Server IP address, hostname, software, and protocol\n- HTTPS flag indicating if the request used HTTPS\n- List of configured package providers with for each:\n   - provider name\n   - configured service URL\n   - username\n- List of the packages that have been installed, including older versions, with\n  the following information for each:\n  - Signature (e.g. redactor-2.2.0-pl)\n  - Created/updated/installed timestamps\n  - Provider installed from\n  - Package name\n  - Version number\n\nThe collected information is added to the SiteDash database, and processed further\nin various ways. This processing may include deduplication, adding more detail from\nother sources, or interpreting raw data into trends or potential improvements.\n\nSiteDash may also connect to your site directly to probe for other information or\nchecks. For example, you may see requests from SiteDash attempting to access your\ncore folder if it is not outside the webroot.\n\n\";s:9:\"changelog\";s:3539:\"SiteDash Client 1.0.0-pl\n-------------------------\nReleased on 2018-12-10\n\n- Downgrade symfony/process to 3.4.20 to support PHP 5.5.9+\n- Provide the server with the assets_url to automatically support non-standard assets directories\n- Backup process no longer depends on exec(), instead using proc_open (like upgrade) which has some wider server support\n\nSiteDash Client 1.0.0-rc4\n-------------------------\nReleased on 2018-11-29\n\n- Try to automatically find the mysqldump executable before accepting the mysqldump_binary setting\n- If the php executable can't automatically be determined, use simply php and assume it's available\n- Check if the exec() function is available before trying the backup\n\nSiteDash Client 1.0.0-rc3\n-------------------------\nReleased on 2018-11-28\n\n- Use Symfony/Process to run the setup for better security and stability\n- Increase download timeout from 15 to 90 seconds\n\nSiteDash Client 1.0.0-rc2\n-------------------------\nReleased on 2018-11-27\n\n- Loosen shell escaping to prevent issues with complex passwords not working for the backup\n- Fix incorrect default for sitedashclient.php_binary setting\n- Fix upgrade on advanced distributions where the core folder has been moved or a custom config key is used\n\nSiteDash Client 1.0.0-rc1\n-------------------------\nReleased on 2018-11-27\n\n- First beta version of upgrading the MODX core!\n- Make sure invalid requests still return a valid JSON response\n- Add file hasher to use for validating upgrades and for keeping an eye on files changing unexpectedly\n- Add backup command to create a local backup of the database and critical files\n- Settings for PHP and mysqldump binaries to use\n\nSiteDash Client 0.7.0-pl\n------------------------\nReleased on 2018-08-02\n\n- Make sure that packages have their names normalised when being loaded to fix inconsistencies\n- Update default server url to the new SiteDash.app domain\n- Now also reports the core path, base url/path and connectors url/path\n\nSiteDash Client 0.6.0-pl\n------------------------\nReleased on 2018-07-24\n\n- Public release.
